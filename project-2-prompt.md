# Project #2: Building Your First Full-stack Application

### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack application.** You'll be **building a Node/Express app,** which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

**This is exciting!** It's a lot, but we've given you the tools to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

**You will be working individually for this project**, and you'll be designing the app yourself. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is one of the the biggest pitfalls for any project!

### Timeline

***Monday night:***
* **Spend tonight coming up with ideas and making plans for your app** 
* **Submit your plans in a markdown file as an issue ticket by 11:00PM**

***Tuesday:***
* **Meet with your instructional team in the morning to go over your project ideas** 
* **If/when you get the greenlight start the planning phase of your project. This should include wireframes,pseudocode etc.**

***Wednesday - Sunday:***
* **Work on and complete projects**

***Monday:***
* **Fix last minute bugs**
* **Take a deep breath**
* **Short presentation on your project** The presentation should include a demo of your app, discussing challenges, and answering questions the class may have.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 2 tables** in the database (more if they make sense) – And should have at _least_ _ONE_ relationship between tables. 
* **Use Express, PG-Promise and EJS**
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* **Access data (with Axios) from at least ONE external API, yours or a third party e.g spotify, reddit etc.**
* **Utilize a database** to interact with your stored data and save API data**
* **Include in your planning:**
  * wireframes
  * pseudocode
  * ERD or some visual representation of your database.
  * Technical specifications.
* **Checkout this [template](Readme-template.md) to get an idea of a good readme**
* **Have semantically clean HTML and CSS and use flexbox to help make your app responsive**
* **Be deployed on heroku** and accessible to the public
* **Use at least one NPM pacakge** that we have not talked about in class
  * This is a list of some top npm libraries [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/star)
* **presentation counts, make sure your app looks modern and is responsive.**

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted on Heroku
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
* **User stories** in your readme

---
### If you reach your MVP:
* **Add additional tables**, as is appropriate for your app.
* **Hit more external API's**
* **Utilize additional NPM packages**, NPM has the largest collection of libraries ever made! Try to include something we haven't covered that will be useful for your app!
* **Use classes to modularize your code**
* **Bonus:** 
  * Use some type of authentication, check out session middleware and a library called passport.
  * Explore making your app work offline, explore local storage or other mechanisms.
### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation, server-side work, API's) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Write Your Pseudocode** Start by stating the problems in plain text. This will help you guide your process and understand the problem better.
* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need. State what your **MVP** looks like.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _to-do lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

- __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes as specified above? Did you use source control (Git) as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

- __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

- __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission?

- __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

- __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

- __Presentation__: Did you present your game, your code, and your project-making experience clearly and effectively to the class?

- __Total__: Your instructors will give you a score for each section between:

| Score          | Expectations   |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| **0**          | _Incomplete._  |
| **1**          | _Does not meet expectations._ |
| **2**          | _Meets expectations, good job!_ |
| **3**          | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_ |


 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
