* Enter a name before starting the process (else one is given by default).
* The viewer must type into the textbox which will be saved as a string when submitted.
* If nothing is typed, a default message will be rendered instead.
* The viewer will then get to see their captions onscreen with their name and a giphy image.
* Finally there will be an option to start fresh which will clean up the database.
